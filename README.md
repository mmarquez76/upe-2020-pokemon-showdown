# UPE Spring 2020 Pokemon Showdown Tournament

## **Please make sure to read these rules in their entirety. Failure to read all rules may result in your inability to participate in the tournament.**

The tournament organizers (TOs) reserve the right to alter or amend these rules at any time.

## Registration & requirements
* Participants must be part of [the Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) Discord server](discord.gg/upefiu) to sign up.
* Participants must create an account at [Pokemon Showdown.](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) 
    * This can be done for free, no email required, by clicking the "Choose name" button in the top right, creating a name, and then going into the top-right settings menu and clicking "Register".  
* **There are no other requirements for players to register.**
* Once these requirements are satisfied, players can sign up by supplying their Discord usernames and Pokemon Showdown usernames through the [tournament signup form](https://go.fiu.edu/upe-poke-tour-su).
* The tournament will be taking place online, **Saturday, April 18th, 2020, starting at 6:00 PM sharp**. 

## Format
* The Swiss system will be used for this tournament, both to more easily accomodate potentially large turnout where single elimination/best of 3 could take too long, and to ensure everyone gets to play multiple games. 
    * Essentially, this means no players are eliminated after each round, players gain points by winning matches, and the player with the most points by the end of the tournament wins.
* Ties will be broken by summing the scores of a player's opponents. In other words, players who beat more higher-scoring players will win in a tie.
* Brackets will be managed through Challonge.com. [Live scores and matchups can be found here.](INSERTLINKFORCHALLONGE) Each Swiss round will take roughly 30 minutes, with a 15 minute buffer in between to set up the next round.
* **Players are responsible for showing up to their matches on time.** Matchups will be announced on the UPE Discord server and displayed on Challonge.
    * If a player is **more than 10 minutes late to their match,** they will **forfeit** the match, and a bye (point-wise, equivalent to a match win) will be awarded to their opponent.
    * It is **players' responsibilities to report late players to the TOs in the UPE Discord using the #disputes channel.**
* At least one (preferably both) player(s) in each match must **report their scores in the UPE Discord using the #score-reporting channel** once their match has ended.
    * Use any format that makes it clear who won and who lost, or whether there was a tie.
    * If a round has ended and both players in a match fail to report their scores by the time the next round starts, they will **both be awarded losses for the round.**
* For more information on the Swiss system, [see this Challonge post.](https://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)

## Gameplay
* Games will be played on the [Pokemon Showdown battle simulator](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/), in the 6v6 singles format, using the Generation 8 Sword/Shield OU metagame with [standard Smogon OU rules.](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/formats/ou/)
    * Players should **save all replays of matches** to make solving potential disputes easier.
* For each match, players should challenge their opponent by **clicking the "Find a user" button** at the bottom right of the home page and inputting their opponent's Pokemon Showdown username.
    * From there, click the "Challenge" button. 
    * **Select the Sw/Sh Singles OU / [Gen 8] OU format.** Matches in **any** other format will not count for the tournament.
    * Lastly, select your team and challenge your opponent. Enjoy your battle!
* Random games in tournament will be streamed live at [the UPE Twitch channel.](htpts://twitch.tv/upefiu). Streamed games will have trainer names censored to protect players' team compositions.

## Teams
