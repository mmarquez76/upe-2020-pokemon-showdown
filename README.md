* Participants must create an account at [Pokemon Showdown.](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/)

    * Players who do not check in by **5:45 PM will be automatically disqualified.**

## Format
* The Swiss system will be used for this tournament. 
    * Essentially, this means no players are eliminated after each round, players gain points by winning matches, and the player with the most points by the end of the tournament wins.
* The tournament will be managed online through [the tournament page at smash.gg](https://smash.gg/tournament/upe2020pkmn). **Please keep the tournament page open at all times during the tournament to check into matches and report match results.**
* Each Swiss round will take roughly 20 minutes, with a 10 minute buffer in between to set up the next round, for a total of **30 minutes per round.** Rounds are **best of 1**.
* **Players are responsible for checking into their matches on time.** Matchups will be announced on the UPE Discord server and through the tournament site.
    * Players can check into their matches at [this page](https://smash.gg/tournament/upe2020pkmn/event/sword-shield-ou-pokemon-showdown-6v6-singles/brackets/794100/1274039) by selecting their match and checking in.
    * If a player is **more than 10 minutes late to their match,** they will **forfeit** the match, and a bye (point-wise, equivalent to a match win) will be awarded to their opponent.
* Both player(s) in each match must **report and confirm their scores [on the tournament site](https://smash.gg/tournament/upe2020pkmn/event/sword-shield-ou-pokemon-showdown-6v6-singles/brackets/794100/1274039)** once their match has ended.

* Random games in tournament will be streamed live at [the UPE Twitch channel.](htpts://twitch.tv/upefiu) Streamed games will have trainer names and avatars hidden to protect players' team compositions.
    * If you'd prefer not to have your games streamed anyways, **please let a TO know in the UPE Discord server.**

## Teams
* All teams should be created beforehand using the [Pokemon Showdown team builder.](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder) This builder will allow players to automatically validate their teams against the Gen 8 OU ruleset.

    * **No cheating/bug exploiting**

* Otherwise, all [Smogon Gen 8 OU rules apply.](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/formats/ou/).

## Disputes
* In the event of a rule violation or a late player during the match, **it is the responsibility of the players to alert a TO.**
* To report a violation, players should alert a TO **by disputing results on the tournament page or the #disputes channel of the UPE Discord Server** and supply the URL to their Pokemon Showdown room if their game is still in progress, or their replay link if the game has ended.
* Players found guilty of simple rule violations will be **given a loss for the round,** and their opponent will be **awarded a bye.**
    * For more serious, continued violations, **TOs reserve the right to disqualify players entirely.**
    * Discretion between simple and serious rule violations lies solely with TOs.
* Disputes without any replay or live game room proof **will be discarded.**

## Prizes
* The two players with the most points **at the end of the fifth round** will each be awarded **any digital game of their choosing under $30.**
* The first-place winner will also be awarded **a special category in the UPE Discord.**
